                The best way to seize the opportunities of the digital economy is to start young. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, started coding when he was thirteen, while Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, began his programming journey at eight years old. The richest man in the world, Elon Musk, started coding at the age of ten. Companies like Twitter, Apple, and Google were started by people who were exposed to technology at a young age.

                It is quite disquieting that thousands of kids living in rural areas in Kenya do not have access to computers and have never interacted with them. These kids are missing out on the endless possibilities provided by digital literacy, and we may be blocking the emergence of a Larry Page or a Jack Dorsey. Digital literacy is very important and could be the engine to drive the economy and inspire progress. Kids in rural areas are usually left behind and become isolated, unable to provide digital solutions to problems in society due to a lack of equipment and effective training.

                Most services being offered by the government have been moved online. Activities such as applying for schools, filing taxes, and applying for a passport are being done online. How is a kid who does not know how to use a computer access these essential services? Digital literacy has transformed from being an “extra” skill to a necessity.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                Equally important, the world is moving towards the fourth industrial revolution, an age characterized by technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, internet of things, and robotics. This is an opportunity for Kenya to revolutionize her economy, provide employment to the youth, and establish herself as a leader in providing these technologies to the world. Is Kenya prepared for the fourth industrial revolution? Without focusing on digital literacy for all kids, the fourth industrial revolution may become a dream that passes like a cloud.

                We need to put in place mechanisms that will ensure every kid gets access to digital literacy and spark their imagination to the endless possibilities of the world. For people to be able to pull themselves by their bootstraps, they first need to have boots. We seek to provide kids with digital literacy boots so that they can be able to pull themselves by their bootstraps.

                We have developed a sustainable program template to deliver the necessary technological resources to schools in rural communities of Kenya. Through collaboration with local and international partners, we aim to establish computer centers in rural areas so that we can provide these kids with the same opportunities as those in urban areas. Our team of professional computer scientists will be responsible for teaching the kids how to use these computers and introduce them to the world of technology.

              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                Our initiative takes a unique approach in the way we offer our training. Instead of passive theoretical lessons, we will be providing hands-on training where the kids will be able to actively interact with technology. We are developing computer software and websites specifically for the program that effectively delivers content through a combination of visual, audio, and game elements. This will ensure that kids comprehend.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                After the kids know how to use a computer, we will be teaching them how to code. Coding is a skill that can be developed from a young age and will enable the kids to tap into their creativity and become problem solvers. This is a skill that can transform their lives in the future by helping them secure jobs; or they can come up with business solutions through the skills acquired that will be a source of employment for others.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                Equally important, the program will be used as a mentorship opportunity for young kids. We will provide them with information to guide them on their educational journey to ensure that they succeed in the future. The program will be used to foster leadership skills, public speaking skills, and boost the self-confidence of kids. This will ensure we properly equip the future generation to be able to achieve their full potential.

                The beneficiaries of this program will be kids between 8 to 12 years old. Children at this age can comfortably apply thinking and are able to form relationships between subjects that are related. At this age, kids will be able to adapt to technology like fish in water.

                <li>Classroom/Community Space - We will require a classroom or a community space that will enable us to store the computing equipment and also act as the training space.</li>
                <li>Furniture - We will require furniture such as tables, chairs, whiteboards, blackboards, and computer stands.</li>
                <li>Computing Equipment - We will require computing equipment with which to teach kids. These include computers, display screens, webcams, and projectors.</li>

                Two events were instrumental in sparking our passion for spreading digital literacy to underserved rural communities.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                First, the story of Martin, a kid with whom we joined in the first year of university to study Information Technology. On the first day of the lecture, the professor requested Martin to set up a computer so that we could use it to project notes. Martin seemed unsure where to start and told the professor that he does not have experience with computers. The professor was surprised, since you do not need any experience to start a computer. The class burst into laughter, another kid took over setting up the computer and the class continued as usual.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                It was only later that we came to realize that Martin had never interacted with a computer before. In his own words, Martin said, “Computers are just things that we hear about, but have not seen or touched.” Most kids in rural areas in Kenya will interact with a computer for the first time when they go to the university. For Martin, the learning curve was steep because he first had to learn how to first use a computer so that he could effectively participate in class activities.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                Our project is dedicated to kids who may not have access to digital skills. These kids are usually smart and with a bright future, but they are not provided with the opportunity to participate in the digital world. Just like Martin, these kids initially find it difficult to fit into the digital world. We seek to empower kids from underserved rural areas with digital and computer literacy.
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
                Equally important, we were inspired by the limitless opportunities provided by digital skills. We would like to spark curiosity, innovation, and entrepreneurship in the younger generations. We seek to plant a seed that will grow, blossom, and produce fruits of employment opportunities, economic progress, and a computer-literate society.
